### Setting your slack status using keywords in Alfred

**NOTE:** For this to work you need the Powerpack Licence as we are going to use the **workflow** feature.

#### How to install and use it?

1. Download the attached file and double click to install it
2. Open Alfred preferences -> Workflows -> Click on the "Slack status" workflow -> Click on the second icon in the right corner -> In the Workflow Environment Variables box enter your token (which you can find [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)) -> Save and close Alfred
3. Run search
4. Type in "s" keyword
5. You will see 4 default statuses (Available, Remote, Meeting, Vacationing), choose one or enter your custom status by first entering the emoji (without colons) followed by the text (separated with space) (e.g. poop What a lovely day)
6. Hit enter!
7. Navigate to your slack to check it out :)

## Can I add my own status?

Of course, just right click in the workflow box and a new "Input keyword" and "Arg and Vars utility" which you will connect to the keyword and script, just inspect one of the defaults.
